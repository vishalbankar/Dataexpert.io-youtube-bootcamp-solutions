We can actually use the Python and notebooks installations included in the spark-iceberg container included in the docker-compose to go through the labs.

Just move or copy
3-spark-fundamentals/src 
3-spark-fundamentals/requirements.txt 
to 
3-spark-fundamentals/notebooks.

Once you do that you can go to your notebooks endpoint http://localhost:8888/ and follow these instructions from there:

Click on New>Terminal
In the terminal that opens up move to the notebooks/notebooks directory with cd /home/iceberg/notebooks/notebooks
Install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
And finally verify it is all working with python3 -m pytest

I hope this saves you a lot of headaches. Just remember (as usual) to save your homework or modifications in a different location before before making a forced git pull, otherwise you will lose your progress.
